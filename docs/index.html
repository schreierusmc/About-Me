    <p> As you can see below my main interest and hobby is being with my family. My wife and I have three young boys who keep us very busy. They play competitive sports and are full of energy. It is important to my wife and I to make sure they grow up in a supportive and respectful household. We usually spend on off time just having fun, in anyway we can. Also, taking a bonafide family vacation every year is very important. This year we are headed to Estes Park, CO to enjoy the mountains and hopefully do a little off-roading in a Jeep!
