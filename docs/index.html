<h1>Jeremy Schreier</h1>
<p> As you can see below my main interest and hobby is being with my family. My wife and I have three young boys who keep us very busy. They play competitive sports and are full of energy. It is important to us that we make sure they grow up in a supportive and respectful household. We usually spend on off time just having fun, in anyway we can. Also, taking a bonafide family vacation every year is very important. This year we are headed to Estes Park, CO to enjoy the mountains and hopefully do a little off-roading in a Jeep!
